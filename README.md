### Letter to Princess Celestia

---
Dear **Princess Celestia**, as **Princess Twilight Sparkle of DevSecOps**, I would I would like to ensure that developers are able to develop features quickly, while being prevented from introducing common vulnerabilities into the application, such as those listed in OWASP Top 10. The solution should secure a common web framework (e.g. Django, Express.js, Spring), to prevent developers from introducing specific classes of vulnerabilities (e.g. XSS, SQLi, command injection, IDOR). 

Such a product is needed to be a simple solution to GovTech hackathon, [STACK the Codes](https://jts.tech.gov.sg/2022/stack-the-codes), how should I go about doing it?

Twilight Sparkle looked over the letter and handed it to Spike who burned it to ashes. With the power of magic, Princess Celestia received the letter.

She wrote, and sent a message back using magic.

**"Simplest?"** Twilight Sparkle wondered to herself as she thought over Celestia's words. Being a DevSecOps princess, she was busy with numerous other things. It was likely she would forgot or lose sight of her task. 

"Wait! That's it!" Twilight Sparkle neighed and galloped to her computer to punch out this masterpiece.

A sidebar with helpful links ot useful OWASP documentation. It contains a list of common vulnerabilities and ways to secure them. The documentation produces useful examples that can be used in any web framework.
